# HTML_AUDIO_MULTIPLE_TRACK-MIX
HTML5 Audio player that utilizes mulitple tracks for pseudo mixing/dj effect  <br>
To test, click play button or select 1-4. Each plays a different version of "rapper's Delight" in synch.<br>
This version uses 4 music files (mp3) that has all the versions of the song and uses javascript to switch in real time
-Please  Note tracks may start simultaneously if you hit play button first. This needs to be fixed.
